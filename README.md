# COVID-19-Vaccination-Analysis

This is a project I did to identify if there are any geographic, and/or economic factor that contributes to the COVID-19 vaccination rate of each country. 

The raw data used are downloaded from kaggle, and the final combined raw data can be found in this repository under country_vaccinations_raw_data.csv. The tableau file can also be accessed via this link: https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19_16770391519370/GlobalVaccineTracker_1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

Please start from the COVID-19 Vaccination Data Analysis.pdf first, before trying out the interactive dashboard in tableau to have a better understanding of the data viz and dashboard.

Thank you for reading
